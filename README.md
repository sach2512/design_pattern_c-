## Overview

The Dependency Injection Design Pattern in C# allows developers to create loosely coupled software components, enhancing maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

## Tight Coupling vs. Loose Coupling

### Tight Coupling
- **Definition**: Occurs when two objects are dependent on each other. Changes in one class necessitate changes in all dependent classes.
- **Impact**: Leads to a rigid code structure, making updates and feature implementations difficult.

### Loose Coupling
- **Definition**: Allows components to change independently without affecting other parts of the system.
- **Benefits**:
  - Easier maintenance and updates.
  - Improved design principles adherence.
  - Enhanced team collaboration.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where a class's dependencies are provided from the outside rather than created internally, fostering loose coupling.

### Key Components

1. **Client Class**: Requires a service.
2. **Service Class**: Provides the required service.
3. **Injector Class**: Creates instances of the service class and injects them into the client class.

### Types of Dependency Injection

- **Constructor Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are provided through the constructor.
  
  ```csharp
  public class Client
  {
      private readonly IService _service;

      public Client(IService service)
      {
          _service = service;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Method Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are provided through method parameters.
  
  ```csharp
  public class Client
  {
      public void Execute(IService service)
      {
          // Use the service here
      }
  }
  ```

- **Property Dependency Injection**: Dependencies are provided through properties.
  
  ```csharp
  public class Client
  {
      public IService Service { get; set; }
  }
  ```

By implementing the Dependency Injection pattern, we can create a cleaner architecture that supports easier maintenance and flexibility in our applications.
